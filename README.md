# vue-pwa-typescript

added vue-bootstrap functionality yay!

This repo is a port of the `pwa` template from Vue 2.5, made to work with Babel 7.x and in particular, [@babel/preset-typescript](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-typescript) for TypeScript support. This means that TypeScript will pass through and use babel-preset-env for its code generation.

## Build Setup

npm install
